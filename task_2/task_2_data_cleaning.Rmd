```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
raw_cake <- read_csv("raw_data/cake/cake-ingredients-1961.csv")

cake_names <- read_csv("raw_data/cake/cake_ingredient_code.csv")
```




```{r}
#pivot longer the raw_cake tibble 

cake_pivot <- raw_cake %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Cake, 
               names_to = "code", 
               values_to = "number")
```



Now need to do a join 
```{r}
cake_joined <- left_join(cake_pivot, cake_names, "code")
```


Now get clean data by getting rid of abbreviations 

```{r}
cake_clean <- cake_joined %>% 
  select(-code)
```

Remove nas
```{r}
cake_clean <- cake_clean %>% 
  drop_na()
```


lower case ingredients 
```{r}
cake_clean <- cake_clean %>% 
  mutate(ingredient = tolower(ingredient)) %>% 
  mutate(Cake = tolower(Cake))
```


```{r}
library(janitor)

cake_clean <- clean_names(cake_clean)
```

Export to csv 
```{r}
write_csv(cake_clean, "clean_data/cake_clean.csv")

```
